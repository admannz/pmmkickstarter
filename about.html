        <h1>The PMM Kickstarter Origin Story</h1>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Like most people who become a Product Marketer, a "PMM" for short, I stumbled into this world quite by accident. I spent the first 15 years of my career as a technical engineer in one way or another, working on green screens and mainframes, VAX systems, the early Server and PC revolution, that amazing transition to laptops and remote access and then Mobile and Cloud. Then it was a shift into technical pre-sales, some actual sales, and then by a stroke of luck I was offered the opportunity to become a Technical Product Marketing Manager, which began a journey that has lasted 17 years and counting. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have had the great fortune to work with both world class leaders and industry leading engineers, amongst others, who took the time to teach me, coach me, demand of me, to get me to this very lucky position of being able to give back.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The PMM Kickstarter is the framework by which I repay the investment others made in me, by paying it forward to those that may not have had the same fortunes I have had, or simply know they need "something" and need some help figuring out what exactly that is.</p>p>
            <br>
            <p>All are welcome here, my resources are limited just now while I still work a "real job", but I will do what I can to help, and over time I will expand the resource pool! I look forward to talking with you.</p>
