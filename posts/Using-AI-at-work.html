                <p><i>Quick note: I’m writing about productivity here, in end-user scenarios. What we’re seeing in business apps and services is way beyond the scope here!</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>AI. You might have heard of it. Little buzz thing going on just now, apparently it might change the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I think it already has, and will continue to change things in both positively impactful and potentially negative ways. It depends on context and perspective. Will it take all our jobs away and make humans irrelevant? I don’t think so. Will it take some jobs away and require retraining and shiftings of ways we get things done? I believe yes. Will it create NET NEW jobs? Also yes.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Humans + AI</h2>
                <p>In the world of product marketing (and peripheral disciplines like evangelism, technical marketing, communications, AR, PR etc) I have found myself cautious. I am very much against auto generated content being spewed out without review. The AI tooling we have today is far too nascent to warrant full and complete trust.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve seen a bunch of generated content that to the uninitiated looks awesome, but when viewing by knowledable and practioner level audiences is quite literally incoherent garbage. Context matters. Perspective matters. Intuition matters. And AI is not good at any of those to the degree required for anyone to just trust and publish out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, I’ve been playing with ChatGPT and Google Gemini over the last few months and have started to see where the “Humans + AI” value is showing positive results.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Practical Use Cases for PMMs</h3>
                <p>Here’s a few within the use cases I’ve personally found intriguing and helpful in Getting Stuff Done. There’s nothing stunningly crazy here, but a lot of the real value is in productivity gains and speeding up execution.</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li><strong>Idea Generation:</strong> Creating a list of interesting things and running up first drafts are obvious kickstarters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Idea Iteration:</strong> Once you have a few things, run up some iterations, generate 10 different versions, quickly test words and meanings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test tone, change perspective:</strong> One of the more impactful things I’ve found, asking the tools to take something written in one voice and shift to a different one, from different role perspectives to first/third person shifts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notebooks As Briefs:</strong> Using Notebooks as a way to aggregate a set of assets common to a topic, generating summaries, briefs, mind maps, FAQ’s and audio podcasts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregating Content:</strong> Import a set of existing assets and create aggregated compilations and summaries to gain multiple uses of the same content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Summarizing Long Form Content:</strong> An impactful way to consume a large amount of content such as reports, and capturing both common and contrasting viewpoints.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transforming Content:</strong> Shape shifting content is time consuming, but moving from slides to docs, transcripts of speeches to slides, audio generation of documents for accessibility such as listening over reading, are all quickly and efficiently done.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Research:</strong> Grab links to a set of pages and sites and let the AI reason over it, summarize, compare, contrast and provide insights.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>As you can see, I bet there’s nothing that jumps off the page and makes you go “holy wow would you look at that”. To which I say … <strong>EXACTLY</strong>. But you know what, I’m saving hours per day, we’re executing orders of magnitude faster, we’re getting from “zero to something” rapidly so that the human aspects can jump straight to the 75-80% mark and finish it up over the last 20%.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’m excited by what these tools can do, and if we adopt carefully, safely, and with an appropriate set of checks and balances as they evolve, we’re heading into an exciting world.</p>
